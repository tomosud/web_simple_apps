00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.919
If you asked the average person what the

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:06.719
first color film was, the majority would

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.880
answer The Wizard of Oz. While the 1939

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:10.400
classic is a masterpiece of color design

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.639
that [music] has ingrained itself into

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.798
the popular consciousness, it was by no

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:16.879
means the first color film. You have to

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:18.239
go back over four decades before The

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:20.719
Wizard of Oz to [music] find the

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.320
earliest use of color in film. The many

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:23.679
experiments with various technologies

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.240
and aesthetics [music] of early color

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.480
film before 1939 highlight The Wizard of

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.719
Oz's influence on the evolution of color

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.840
filmm and the inspiration it continues

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:34.839
to provide filmmakers today.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.920
As soon as cameras made movies possible

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.600
in the 1890s, [music] filmmakers

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.920
attempted to add color to their black

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.760
and white images. In order to do so,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.920
many early filmmakers, such as George

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:52.159
Millier, handp painted their films frame

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.320
by frame, having to redo the process for

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.078
each individual print of the film. As

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.000
the film industry grew and production

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.605
companies replaced the lone showman,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.280
companies like Path would streamline

00:00:59.604 --> 00:01:03.119
[music] this process, setting up a

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.198
factory line of female colorists and

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.679
even creating stencils for each frame to

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:09.118
more accurately apply color dyes.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.960
Production companies would charge

00:01:09.118 --> 00:01:12.719
theaters more money for color prints

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.478
compared to a black and white version of

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.239
the same film in order to make this

00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:18.239
involved colorization process

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:20.560
financially feasible. During the early

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:22.879
years of film, color wasn't used to

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.040
depict reality so much as it was to add

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:26.640
a visual flare. The results were

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.720
absolutely stunning. From [music] the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.320
earliest Annabel Serpentine dances

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.078
colored to match the flittering lights

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.839
of the vaudeville stage to the

00:01:32.078 --> 00:01:35.679
fantastical worlds of Melza's

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.439
adventures, you can see how much more

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.439
detail there is between the black and

00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:41.199
white and color versions of Milier's A

00:01:39.438 --> 00:01:42.835
trip to the moon. The characters more

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.960
easily stand out from the background

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:46.879
[music] and Mesa's fantastical world

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.879
comes to life with this added color.

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:51.039
Despite handdrawn colors extravagant

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:53.438
look, colorizing moving characters and

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.600
objects proved extremely difficult. For

00:01:53.438 --> 00:01:57.599
example, in this George Millier's film,

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.599
the red on the devil's costume jumps

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.599
about wildly as he gestures and moves

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.519
about the frame. Even for static

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:05.519
backgrounds, the colors often jump

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:07.118
around outside the lines. And for the

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:09.118
more visually complex parts of the

00:02:07.118 --> 00:02:11.360
image, they would be unnaturally baked

00:02:09.118 --> 00:02:12.959
in one single color, such as this red

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.520
blob, struggling to cover the light

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.120
given off from a flittering flame. These

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.879
limitations didn't completely kill the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.159
use of hand-drawn color in silent film.

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:24.239
However, later films like 1924's Greed

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.479
even used a handdrawn coloring process

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.319
for select scenes. The development of

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.840
machine printed stencils would slightly

00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:31.598
improve the stabilization of these

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.159
colors, but it couldn't fix this fatal

00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:36.399
flaw. The labor required to color each

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.840
individual frame quickly ballooned

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.000
budgets and added months onto

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.759
post-prouction. As films grew in length

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.840
from five to 10 minute shorts in the

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:46.239
early 20th century to hour-long

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.000
spectacles by the mid 1910s, hand

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.159
coloring and stenciling became an

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
increasingly unsustainable practice. In

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.560
the rare cases complete feature films

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.639
were colored by hand, such as the 1925

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.039
French film Srano de Bersiac,

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.719
post-prouction dragged on for years.

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:03.679
While shooting wrapped on the set in

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:06.479
1923, the nearly 2-hour film only hit

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.640
theaters 2 years later, the time used

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:11.280
for a team of dozens of technicians to

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.878
add color to each frame. As French film

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.959
companies struggled to standardize and

00:03:12.878 --> 00:03:16.878
simplify this hand coloring process,

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.959
another simpler color process called

00:03:16.878 --> 00:03:21.199
tinting came to dominate the industry

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.039
around the world. Tinting only required

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.598
the film prints to be soaked in liquid

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:27.840
solutions of color dye to add a single

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:29.359
color uniformally across the image,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.920
changing the color of lighter parts of

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.920
the image the most. Sometimes a whole

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.518
film was dyed the same color, while most

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.518
films were dyed specific colors for

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.360
different scenes and shots. A similar

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.280
process also gained popularity during

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.120
this time called Tony, which manipulated

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.680
the color by chemically altering the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.759
film strip silver particles to alter the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.120
dark sections of the image. This could

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:51.359
be combined with tinting to create

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.200
striking visuals with more than just one

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.959
color. Alongside creating unique

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.479
visuals, tinting was also used

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.560
throughout the silent era to set the

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.479
mood or help viewers identify specific

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.080
locations. Blue tints were often used

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:04.079
for night scenes, [music] red for scenes

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.080
with fire, green for outdoor landscapes,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.680
and yellow for the desert. Tinting

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.519
proved efficient and much cheaper than

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.159
hand coloring and quickly overtook the

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.239
film industry. Estimates today place 85%

00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:16.798
of all Hollywood films featuring some

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.280
tinting by the early 1920s. Despite this

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:21.279
common use, the process still lacked the

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.439
ability to reproduce natural color on

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.359
screen. In order to capture color as we

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:26.800
see it in everyday life, cinema would

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.800
first need the work of numerous

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.879
inventors to craft equipment that could

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.600
photograph and then project realistic

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.600
color on screen.

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:41.680
After years of experiments, British

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:43.918
filmmaker George Albert Smith [music]

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.800
invented the first natural color process

00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:48.959
dubbed Kinemacolor in 1907. In order to

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.879
capture and reproduce color on screen,

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:53.279
Smith's Kinemacolor camera used a

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.120
rotating red and green color filter to

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.799
take alternating images with one frame

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.639
shot through the red filter and the next

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.160
frame shot through the green filter. The

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.400
resulting film, as seen by this

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
surviving Kimacolor film strip, looks

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:05.519
black and white with just slight

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.280
differences to the hues in the

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:09.038
alternating images. [music] In order to

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:11.038
see color during the film screening,

00:05:09.038 --> 00:05:13.519
Smith projected the film strip using a

00:05:11.038 --> 00:05:15.918
speciallymade Kimacolor projector with a

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:18.240
rotating red and green filter identical

00:05:15.918 --> 00:05:20.079
to the one used by his camera. As the

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.759
audiences saw these images projected

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:22.879
back through the projector spinning red

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.120
and green filter, [music]

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:27.120
the human eye combined both images as

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.720
one to see all the colors captured on

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.720
the red and green [music] spectrum.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.039
While Canacolor was a huge step forward

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.720
in the development of color film, there

00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:37.360
was still plenty of drawbacks to the

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.120
method. First, Kimacolor needed special

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.879
cameras and specially manufactured

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.959
projectors, making it incredibly

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.399
difficult to market commercially. Many

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:46.399
production companies simply couldn't

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:47.918
afford specially designed cameras, and

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:49.679
even more theaters couldn't afford a

00:05:47.918 --> 00:05:51.918
novelty projector for just a small

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.000
handful of films. Second, the [music]

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:56.399
process only captured colors on a red

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.240
and green spectrum. No blue as far as

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:00.239
the eye could see, even when at the

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.079
ocean. And most of all, the filters

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.240
struggled to reproduce color of moving

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:05.839
subjects. Red and green blurs were

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.079
common when projecting these films, as

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:10.159
the red and green alternating images

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:11.918
were taken just a split second apart. As

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.919
these Kinacolor films were demonstrated

00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:15.359
to the public, several reviewers of the

00:06:13.918 --> 00:06:17.038
early process complained of headaches

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.720
and eye strain as a result of the

00:06:17.038 --> 00:06:20.719
bouncing [music] colors. With these

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.120
technical issues, Kimacolor would hit

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.720
financial trouble in the mid1 1910s and

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.199
faded into irrelevance shortly

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.280
thereafter. Other longforgotten color

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.280
ventures from the Brewers color process

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.359
to Kodak's experimental Kodakchrome

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:34.799
process took up the baton and carrying

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.800
the search for a realistic color

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.879
forward. But only one company from this

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.199
time period would go on to drastically

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:43.199
alter the look of films for decades to

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:45.280
come. Here's where Technicolor enters

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.360
our story. More than two decades before

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:49.279
their role in making The Wizard of Oz,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.319
the company produced a now lost color

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:54.239
feature film in 1917. For this film,

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.080
Technicolor had its very own color

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.079
system, [music] ditching the Kimacolor

00:06:56.079 --> 00:07:00.000
rotating red and green filters and

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:02.399
opting instead for a colored prism in

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.160
the camera. They use mirrors to record a

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:06.560
red filtered and a green filtered image

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.479
on a filance strip at the same time.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.560
Then they used a specially designed

00:07:08.478 --> 00:07:12.079
projector to project both the red and

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.319
green images on top of each other

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:16.079
simultaneously attempting to eliminate

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:17.759
the blurriness inherent in the Kenma

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:19.680
color system. When screening their test

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:21.280
film to the public, however, the system

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.120
struggled to work. Lining up the

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:24.959
projected red and green images perfectly

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.120
on top of each other proved difficult

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:28.560
for even the most skilled projectionist.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.560
Knowing this process would never be

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.478
commercially viable, the company went

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.399
back to the drawing board. Technicolor's

00:07:32.478 --> 00:07:36.318
first foray into color feature film

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:38.318
making wasn't a complete loss, however,

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:40.160
as the beam splitting prism used inside

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.400
the camera would prove a fundamental

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.479
aspect to their future success. After

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:47.198
four full years of tinkering later,

00:07:44.478 --> 00:07:48.879
Technicolor's Joseph Arthur Ball in 1921

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:51.120
came up with a new and improved color

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:53.519
process. Using the same beam splitter

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.680
from their previous process, Ball copied

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:58.478
the alternating red and green filtered

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.160
images onto two separate film strips,

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:02.560
one of those being dyed red and the

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.639
other dyed green before they were glued

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.800
back together. The now single strip of

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:08.720
colored film with the red images facing

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.240
one side and the green images facing the

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.479
other side could be run [music] through

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.879
any projector, unlocking previously

00:08:12.478 --> 00:08:17.038
untapped theaters across the world.

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:19.360
Nicknamed twostrip technicolor. This

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:21.360
color process became the first regularly

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.160
used natural color system in Hollywood

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.400
films. 1922's the toll of the sea was

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.680
shot exclusively in twostrip technicolor

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:29.519
and would likely have been many

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.519
theatergoers first exposure to the

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:33.278
company's name. The film was met with

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:35.278
high praise for its color with film

00:08:33.278 --> 00:08:36.799
daily calling it decidedly the best

00:08:35.278 --> 00:08:38.958
thing that has been accomplished in

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.718
colors. While not caring for the story,

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.718
this same reviewer specifically called

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:45.040
out the improvements over past systems,

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:47.600
pointing out that the tones are clear,

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:49.838
unconfused, and the colors do not jump.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.839
This is one particular satisfaction not

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:53.440
to have the various hues running into

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:55.839
each other where they are not intended

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.680
to combine. The outlines in this are

00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:59.519
always very definite, and another

00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:01.679
excellent feature of this process is

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:03.839
naturalness. The toll of the sea looks

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:06.079
like a decided advancement in this field

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:07.680
of endeavor. Despite its rave reviews

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.759
and the toll the seas successful

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:11.759
publicity, two strip tentacolor still

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:13.759
had plenty of technological limitations

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:15.600
just like its predecessors. The biggest

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:18.080
problem was that the two separate red

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.600
and green film strips cemented together

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.600
frequently separated while running

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.200
through projectors compromising numerous

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.600
screenings in theaters across the

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.440
country. Also, whenever the film strips

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.278
were scratched, a common occurrence when

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.279
a film was repeatedly screened, these

00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:32.958
scratches were bright red and green,

00:09:31.278 --> 00:09:35.278
much more apparent than on regular black

00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:37.199
and white films. These issues limited

00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:39.600
two-strip technicolor's widespread use

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.080
for entire feature films with only a

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.240
couple being made in the mid 1920s such

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.000
as Douglas Fairbanks's 1926

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.000
swashbuckling adventure, The Black

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.839
Pirate. Instead, the two-strip

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.240
tentacolor process was mostly used

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:55.120
throughout the 1920s in single scenes in

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.680
big budget spectacles. Films like MGM's

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.159
first big hit Ben her and the Phantom of

00:09:57.679 --> 00:10:02.159
the Opera included brief color scenes

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:05.039
usually showing decadent costumes and

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:07.919
large spectacular sets. Cesop Deill ever

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:10.319
the showman used color in his 1927 Jesus

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:12.639
biopic the King of Kings to show both

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.800
the scandalous parties of Mary Magdalene

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:16.720
preconversion and to capture the

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:18.719
reverence of Jesus's resurrection on

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.079
Easter morning. Color was also used

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.240
during this time period to sell

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:23.759
Hollywood's biggest stars. Gloria

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.320
Swanson appeared in color in a dream

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:28.240
sequence in 1925's stage struck while

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.079
Buster Keaton filmed a short one minute

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.000
opening scene for his comedy Seven

00:10:30.078 --> 00:10:33.919
Chances that same year. I even

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.559
occasionally appear in two strip and

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:38.719
while not a big Hollywood star I do talk

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:40.719
a lot about them doing deep dives into

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.399
silent and early film history. So make

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.560
sure you subscribe to see me in my next

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:47.278
big tentacolor video essay. But enough

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:49.119
of me. Let's dive back in. Not satisfied

00:10:47.278 --> 00:10:50.720
with just shooting short color snippets

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.360
and otherwise black and white tinted

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.600
films, Tetacolor spent the mid1 1920s

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.000
tinkering again with their process, in

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.399
1928, Teacolor revamped their color

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.240
process, now able to print both red and

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:04.000
green images on a single film strip

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.919
without having to cement two separate

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.679
film strips together. With this new

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:09.759
change, making the film strips more

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:11.439
durable for projection, Teacolor

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:13.519
positioned itself rather well for the

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.519
early days of sound film just as it was

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:18.720
starting to take over Hollywood. As the

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:20.480
movie musical was born, 1929 and 1930

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.800
saw a massive boom in technicolor

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.399
featurelength films. Color proved to be

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:26.240
a perfect companion with the all

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:28.639
talking, all dancing, all singing

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.480
musical extravaganza, adding another

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:32.399
flourish to convince audiences to come

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.159
to the theater in the early days of the

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:36.159
Great Depression. While many of these

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:38.319
early sound color films were in the

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:39.838
previous style of goddy showmanship, a

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.519
few from this trend hinted at the

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:43.839
artistic capabilities color could

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:45.600
provide to filmmakers. 1930s The King of

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:47.279
Jazz, for instance, experimented with

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.278
color lighting for its musical review

00:11:47.278 --> 00:11:50.958
numbers, providing a distinct look for

00:11:49.278 --> 00:11:52.879
Paul Whiteitman's music and Duke

00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.559
Ellington's Rapsidity and Blue,

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:56.559
substituting green and silver for the

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:59.039
blue that Technicolor's twostrip process

00:11:56.559 --> 00:12:01.199
still could not capture. As audiences

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:03.838
tired of Hollywood's deluge of early

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.079
sound musical reviews, two strip still

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:10.320
had one last harrah in an unlikely

00:12:06.078 --> 00:12:12.399
genre, horror. 1932's Dr. X and 1933's

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.160
The Mystery of the Wax Museum might have

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:16.559
been the last Hollywood feature film

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:18.399
shot entirely in the two-strip process,

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:20.239
but they similarly foreshadowed the

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:22.480
possibilities of color as more than just

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.240
a visual flare. Rather than using color

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.639
to show goddy costumes, of kicking

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.720
chorus girls, these two films used the

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:31.360
red green palette to create an eerie,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.360
unsettling atmosphere. The uncanny look

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.600
of a world without a third of the color

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:38.240
wheel added to both films maniacal

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.399
serial killers dasterly deeds capturing

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.039
the grotesque science experiments of Dr.

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:44.958
X and the museum's cursed wax figures

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:46.799
with dramatic flare impossible to

00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:49.039
replicate with the same power and black

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:51.838
and white even as films like the king of

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:54.159
jazz and Dr. X tests out creative ways

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:56.079
to use natural color as more than just a

00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:57.919
simple gimmick to get butts and seats.

00:12:56.078 --> 00:12:59.679
Tentacolor's limitations would need

00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:01.919
further improvements to convince the

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:03.599
film industry to fully embrace their new

00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:06.078
color process as the standard for

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.079
featurelength films. Tentacolor had long

00:13:06.078 --> 00:13:10.159
saw their biggest hurdle as replicating

00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:12.479
colors across the full spectrum. And

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:14.799
after years of laboratory experiments,

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.278
in 1932, Tennacolor would finally crack

00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:19.199
the case, creating a completely revamped

00:13:17.278 --> 00:13:21.278
approach to capturing natural color that

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.680
would forever change the trajectory of

00:13:21.278 --> 00:13:24.679
film history.

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:32.559
The company's new process was dubbed

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:35.199
three strip. The new camera's beam

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:37.679
splitter now reflected red, green, and

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.519
blue light onto three separate black and

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:41.120
white film strips running through the

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:43.039
camera simultaneously. In

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.039
post-prouction, Technicolor would then

00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:47.199
combine these three color negative film

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:49.439
strips alongside a black and white film

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.360
stock for image stability into one

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.600
positive film strip that could be shown

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.839
in any projector. With this new but

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.600
still expensive process, Technicolor

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:59.519
believed it had finally overcome the

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.278
major technological downfalls that had

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:03.360
limited the two-strip process's

00:14:01.278 --> 00:14:05.039
potential to become fully adopted by the

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.639
film industry. With the checkered

00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:08.879
complicated history of color technology

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:10.480
in the years prior, however, Tentacolor

00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:12.639
still had to prove to the studios that

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.440
their streamlined new color process was

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:17.519
improved and reliable. To do just that,

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.600
Tentacolor struck an exclusive deal with

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:22.720
a young Walt Disney to test out their

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.800
new system in his short cartoons. 1932's

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.879
Flowers and Trees debuted to the

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:28.559
three-strip tentacolor process on film

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:31.120
to rave reviews from critics and

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:33.359
audiences alike. A blue sky, purple

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.879
flowers, and orange and yellow flames

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.278
showed off their respected colors

00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:39.679
flawlessly. Following this Oscarinning

00:14:37.278 --> 00:14:41.919
short cartoon, Disney produced all his

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:43.919
subsequent cartoons using the same new

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:45.599
three-strip tentacolor process,

00:14:43.919 --> 00:14:47.919
separating himself from his competitors,

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.320
who still only had access to processes

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:51.919
that used the red green spectrum.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.920
Despite the success of Disney's color

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:56.078
cartoons, Hollywood was still skeptical

00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:57.919
of the new color process. Shooting live

00:14:56.078 --> 00:15:00.319
color footage proved unique challenges

00:14:57.919 --> 00:15:01.838
that weren't present in color animation.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.920
Photographing in color required

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:06.079
extremely bright lights, both expensive

00:15:03.919 --> 00:15:08.159
for the studio and a health hazard for

00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:10.078
the actors. Cameramen would have to work

00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:11.600
with the Tentacolor's company's loaned

00:15:10.078 --> 00:15:13.439
out cameramen and would have to be

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.759
trained to the new cameras on company

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.839
time. Cinematographers, set designers,

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:19.519
and costume artists alike would also

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:21.600
have to relearn their respective crafts

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:23.440
to make room for color. Hollywood

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.399
tepidly dipped their toes into this new

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.160
process in 1934, shooting several short

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:32.159
liveaction films in three strip

00:15:28.159 --> 00:15:34.000
tendolor. 1934's Oscar winning short

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:35.919
showed off the new technology

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.320
overloading the screen with color. Too

00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:40.479
much that is every wall, every minor

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.120
background character, almost every minor

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.879
detail is a distinct color. On top of it

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.198
all, colored lights flash upon the

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:49.198
actors, trying to clumsily project their

00:15:47.198 --> 00:15:51.519
inner emotion. Look, there's a red

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:53.838
spotlight in his face. Gee, he must be

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:55.440
angry. Lucaracha showed the promise of

00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:57.360
the new three ship tentacolor,

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.440
reproducing natural color with flare,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.600
but it also showed integrating the new

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.600
color scheme naturally into pictures

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.278
would be done through trial and error.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.040
The technology might be available to

00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:08.958
capture natural color on screen, [music]

00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:11.439
but the aesthetics of color on film had

00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:13.198
a long way to go. Three strip to color

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.839
continued its experiments with its first

00:16:13.198 --> 00:16:18.000
feature film the next year in 1935's

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:20.560
Becky Sharp. Set in 19th century

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.559
England, the film uses its costumes in

00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:24.799
upper class socialite homes to show off

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:27.039
its new palette of colors. More subdued

00:16:24.799 --> 00:16:29.039
than Lukarach's color, Becky Sharp

00:16:27.039 --> 00:16:30.879
focused on reproducing accurate skin

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:33.278
tones and aimed to better mesh color

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:35.360
with the film's narrative. Still, Becky

00:16:33.278 --> 00:16:37.039
Sharp is too infatuated with its color

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.879
palette that it overtakes the film

00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:40.480
completely, giving each character

00:16:38.879 --> 00:16:42.240
unnaturally colored outfits and

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.278
overpowering the screen with so many

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.440
unnatural blue walls. We get it. You can

00:16:45.278 --> 00:16:49.759
shoot blue on film. That doesn't mean

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.680
every wall has to be blue, though.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:53.759
Watching Becky Sharp today, the film is

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:55.599
jarring with too many colors clashing

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:57.600
against each other. Like with every

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.000
experiment, though, there are successes

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.920
alongside the failures. For instance,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
director Ruben Mimoleian tested out

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:05.599
low-key lighting setups that shrouded

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.838
his actors in the foreground and

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:10.078
darkness contrasted with a brighter

00:17:07.838 --> 00:17:11.519
background. The dark blue mixed with the

00:17:10.078 --> 00:17:13.599
yellow light on the statue in the

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:15.119
foreground of this balcony scene is a

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:17.038
stunning visual that would have been

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:19.119
impossible to capture in the two-strip

00:17:17.038 --> 00:17:21.199
tentacolor process. In the same way,

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:23.038
despite its visual flashes, critics

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:24.640
agreed that the film tried too hard to

00:17:23.038 --> 00:17:27.119
showcase its color with the New York

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.600
Times critic Andrew Senwald suggesting

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:31.759
that Tentacolor and future films try to

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:33.918
reduce this new and spectacular element

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:36.079
of color to a position in relation to

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:38.640
the film as a whole, where color will

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:40.480
impinge more violently upon the basic

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.120
photographic image than sound does

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.640
today. Technicolor took Senald's advice

00:17:43.119 --> 00:17:46.959
with a company's next three-strip

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.120
Technicolor film, Trail of the Lonesome

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.600
Pine, taking a more subdued approach to

00:17:49.119 --> 00:17:54.000
color. As the first Teacolor film shot

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:55.678
outdoors, the movie succeeds in large

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.679
part because it doesn't overload the

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:59.600
frame with a cacophony of colors,

00:17:57.679 --> 00:18:01.840
relying on the natural landscape of blue

00:17:59.599 --> 00:18:04.000
skies, the green trees, and the autumn

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:06.079
foliage to provide its color. The film's

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.440
cinematographer, William H. Green

00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:09.359
discussed in the International

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.200
Photographer magazine how when designing

00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:13.038
the look of the Trail of the Lonesome

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.720
Pine, they deliberately distanced

00:18:13.038 --> 00:18:16.400
themselves from the colorly distracting

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.720
set design and costumeuming of the

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.559
actors of earlier color films. In the

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.480
Trail of the Lonesome Pine, when a

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:24.639
character naturally would wear a pair of

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.640
dirty black trousers, that's what he

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.480
wore in this film and not a pair of

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.480
bright red ones with green stripes

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.240
running down the sides. The audience

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.480
will not be conscious for the fact that

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.558
they are looking at color. They will

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.960
only see men and women going about the

00:18:36.558 --> 00:18:40.480
business of life looking real. This

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.240
approach resulted in a much more

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.079
believable look, appeasing still

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.919
skeptical critics and exciting audiences

00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:48.079
by the new possibilities of color,

00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:50.640
making the film one of the top 10 box

00:18:48.079 --> 00:18:52.960
office hits of 1936 with plenty of

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.799
critical praise. Subsequent 1930s

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.640
technicolor films followed the trail of

00:18:54.798 --> 00:18:58.720
the Lonesome Pines's more subdued

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.799
approach as color began to be better

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.798
integrated into critical and box office

00:19:00.798 --> 00:19:05.279
successes. Take the look of Norman

00:19:02.798 --> 00:19:07.279
Maine's apartment in 1937's A Star Is

00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:09.678
Born. There is still color, but the gold

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:12.000
frames and green curtains pop out from

00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:13.519
the otherwise brown and drab apartment.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.599
Without letting color dominate the

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:17.839
audience's attention, the set gives off

00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:19.519
a simple but sophisticated vibe. The

00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:21.599
perfect match for a welloff but

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:23.679
unassuming bachelor's apartment. This

00:19:21.599 --> 00:19:25.519
subdued approach didn't mean color never

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:27.600
called attention to itself. However, A

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:30.400
Star Is Born and other mid1930s

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:32.319
tentacolor films still use color to make

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.080
impressive visuals, relying not on

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:36.000
bright hues overloading the frame like

00:19:34.079 --> 00:19:37.839
in Becky Sharp, but through consistent

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.839
color palettes and various lighting

00:19:37.839 --> 00:19:42.319
effects. The next years, The Adventures

00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:44.639
of Robin Hood swung the pendulum back to

00:19:42.319 --> 00:19:46.558
using a wide array of bright hues across

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.559
the color spectrum that the early three

00:19:46.558 --> 00:19:51.279
strip tentacolor experiments employed.

00:19:48.558 --> 00:19:53.279
However, 1938's The Adventures of Robin

00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:54.720
Hood better integrated colors seamlessly

00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:56.639
into the story without taking the

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.000
audience out of the film. Take for

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.000
example our introduction to the

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.400
villainous Sir Guy. While the shot has

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.640
vibrant blues, golds, and reds, they are

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.720
isolated to specific parts of the frame,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.480
not trying to compete for our attention.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.000
Contrast this shot with Lakaracha's

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.160
color lights drowning out the colors of

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.759
its dancers, or Becky Sharp's blue walls

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.038
and curtains distracting our focus from

00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:17.279
the actions of characters in the

00:20:15.038 --> 00:20:19.279
foreground. The natural browns and grays

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:20.960
seen in A Stars Born provide the

00:20:19.279 --> 00:20:23.038
backdrop to let the vibrant colors in

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.640
the frame pop out and naturally direct

00:20:23.038 --> 00:20:26.798
our eye to the main action and

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.720
characters in the scene. By blending the

00:20:26.798 --> 00:20:30.720
exhibitionist and the subdued approaches

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.558
to color, The Adventures of Robin Hood

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.480
helped set the template for flamboyant

00:20:32.558 --> 00:20:36.720
displays of color that fit narratively

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.720
within the story. Building on this more

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.720
consistent and streamlined use of color,

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.480
the films of 1939 would take this

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.858
approach to new heights and forever

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.120
cement and change our understanding

00:20:43.858 --> 00:20:48.119
[music] of film color.

00:20:51.279 --> 00:20:55.599
As we've seen, color oncreen didn't

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:57.359
start when Dorothy opened her sepiaone

00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:59.678
door and walked into the colorful world

00:20:57.359 --> 00:21:01.359
of Oz. But that doesn't mean this iconic

00:20:59.679 --> 00:21:03.440
film didn't change the way we look at

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:05.279
color forever. Set in the fantastical

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.200
world of Oz, the film could capture

00:21:05.279 --> 00:21:09.119
garish colors and not only make

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.798
narrative sense, but create a world

00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:12.798
unlike anything committed to the screen

00:21:10.798 --> 00:21:14.960
up until that point. Gone are the

00:21:12.798 --> 00:21:16.798
neutral backgrounds of A Stars Born in

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.480
the Adventures of Robin Hood, replaced

00:21:16.798 --> 00:21:20.960
instead by the glowing yellow brick

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.279
road, the radiant pink flowers, and the

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.360
neon green of the wizard's lair. In

00:21:23.279 --> 00:21:27.599
front of those bright backdrops, we have

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:29.918
more expressive colors. Dorothy's iconic

00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:31.918
blue blouse and most importantly the red

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:34.000
ruby slippers changed from the silver

00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:36.480
slippers of Frank Bomb's original story

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.159
for a more appealing look on screen. All

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.519
the bright colors don't clash between

00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:41.039
background and foreground [music] but

00:21:39.519 --> 00:21:43.759
are seamlessly integrated into the

00:21:41.038 --> 00:21:45.919
film's mess and scene. Prior to 1939,

00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:47.919
Teeter was used mostly in dramas and

00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:50.000
musicals, but the Wizard of Oz showed

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:51.840
color's potential in the fantasy genre,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.079
creating another world altogether

00:21:51.839 --> 00:21:56.079
different from our own reality. Several

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:57.599
months after the Wizard of Oz release,

00:21:56.079 --> 00:21:59.519
Gone with the Wind would incorporate

00:21:57.599 --> 00:22:01.839
dark and expressive lighting, typically

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:03.918
used in black and white cinematography

00:22:01.839 --> 00:22:05.839
and further cement the formula and look

00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:08.960
for color that become a mainstay in

00:22:05.839 --> 00:22:10.798
1940s Hollywood and beyond. As 1939 drew

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.720
to a close with the Wizard of Oz and

00:22:10.798 --> 00:22:14.960
Gone with the Winds critical successes

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.798
and enthusiastic audience reaction,

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.440
Three Strip Tentacolor had achieved what

00:22:16.798 --> 00:22:20.879
no other color process had done before.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.798
Winning over the public and the [music]

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.640
critics to become a welcome permanent

00:22:22.798 --> 00:22:26.798
addition to the feature film going

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.480
experience. Despite this monumental

00:22:26.798 --> 00:22:30.240
triumph, there would be more work to be

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.480
done before color was adopted for the

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.720
vast majority of films in Hollywood.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.798
Large budgets, cumbersome technology,

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.038
and the artistic possibilities of black

00:22:36.798 --> 00:22:41.519
and white cinematography still kept

00:22:39.038 --> 00:22:43.599
color as an extra expense reserved for

00:22:41.519 --> 00:22:46.319
select group of prestige studio releases

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:48.240
throughout much of the 1940s and50s. Not

00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:49.918
until less expensive color processes

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.519
like Eastman color loosened

00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:53.440
Technicolor's dominance over the film

00:22:51.519 --> 00:22:55.200
industry in the ' 50s and60s [music] did

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.519
the number of color films produced in

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.159
Hollywood outnumber those made in black

00:22:57.519 --> 00:23:03.200
and white in 1967. But that's a deep

00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:04.799
dive for another time. Now nearly a

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.720
century removed from the days of the

00:23:04.798 --> 00:23:08.720
earliest through ship tacic color films

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.079
and well over a century from the days of

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.480
handc colored and tinted film [music]

00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:14.240
color processes, these early color films

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.839
still have the power to enrapture us

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.240
today. [music] From the fantastical

00:23:15.839 --> 00:23:20.240
fantasies of millier to the uncanny but

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:23.519
extravagant looks of the red and greens

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.359
of two strip to the vibrant world of Oz

00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:27.200
in an age of movies made for streaming

00:23:25.359 --> 00:23:29.119
with drab gray browns [music] and

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.720
unintelligible shadows. And funny

00:23:29.119 --> 00:23:32.399
enough, for many that would include the

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.720
recent Wicked films as well. [music]

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.880
These first color films are ripe for

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.120
rediscovery by audiences hungry for the

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.880
whole color spectrum. Perhaps some

00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:43.038
modern-day filmmakers could even stand

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.200
to relearn the lessons of those color

00:23:43.038 --> 00:23:47.440
pioneers who showed the world the vast

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.880
possibilities of cinematic color that we

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:52.640
have long taken for granted.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.720
